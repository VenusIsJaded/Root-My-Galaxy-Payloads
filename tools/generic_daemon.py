"""Which KMIs a daemon carries, and the feed entry that offers it.

A pair's daemon embeds exactly the module built for its own target, so it is served to that one
device. That is the right default. The KernelSU half is also the only part of a payload that does
not have to be device-specific: `ksud` picks its kernel module from its own asset directory by KMI
at run time - `format!("{kmi}_kernelsu.ko")` - so a daemon carrying one module per KMI serves every
device whose KMI is in that set. The hand-built `ksud-samsung-*` bundles already work this way
(`ksud-samsung-android12-5.10-kdp` carries three KMIs), and this is the tool that reads that set
back out of a binary instead of trusting a name that only mentions one of them.

Two things are read, and neither is guessed at:

- **The asset table.** The loader indexes it by KMI, and it is a contiguous run of
  `<kmi>_kernelsu.ko` names in rodata. It is the only evidence that a daemon carries a module
  rather than having been built beside one - which is why the size of a daemon is not a proxy for
  it, and why a name like `ksud-samsung-android12-5.10-kdp` cannot be parsed for the set.
- **The version** the daemon was stamped with, from `pairs.daemon_version`, which is `ksud -V`'s own
  answer (`3.3.0 (uapi: 4)`). A generic daemon is rebuilt when a KernelSU release moves, so this is
  what a client needs to offer the manager that matches the kernel the run loads.

The feed this writes is a separate file, `support/kernelsu-generic.json`, and that is deliberate:
`support/targets-v3.json` is a released client contract that is rewritten in place by span edits,
and a device's entry in it has to keep naming exactly the artifact that device was tested with. A
generic daemon is a tier of its own, so it gets a file of its own, and the entries that are working
today are not touched by any of this.

The version is the one thing a generic daemon cannot always be asked for. The three hand-built
bundles already in this repository - `ksud-s25u-kdp` and its two siblings - predate the version
string `ksud -V` answers with, and read back as nothing at all; the self-test below pins that,
because it is the reason `--version` comes from the run's tag rather than from the binary. A daemon
built by the workflow below is stamped, so the two agree - but a publish that *needed* the binary
to answer would silently drop the field on an entry the app needs it for.
